This is an extension of 20h's 9pc client for 9p2000 to a complete implementation of the protocol.

The module is divided into three parts:
The example Client.
The example Server.
the shared library "ninepc" of protocol functions.

This library implements all messages in the 9p2000 protocol.

Warning: the server and client are very minimal and only serve as examples for
creating the messages in the protocol.  No validation is performed on the messages.

The server implements a bare bones virtual file server.
The client supports basic actions like file creation/deletion and listing on the server.
